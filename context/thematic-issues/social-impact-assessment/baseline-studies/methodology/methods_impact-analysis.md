## Methodology for Impact Analysis

### 'Triangulation' of data sources

'Triangulation' is a term used by social scientists to describe the the technique of integrating multiple lines of analysis to ensure the integrity of data sources and analytical practices. The term 'triangulation' is borrowed from navigational techniques for locating a single point in multi-dimensional space by evaluating the convergence of measurements from other distinct points. The idea is that one can be more confident with a result of data collection and analysis if different methods lead to the same outcomes. Triangulation can be used in both quantitative (validation) and qualitative (inquiry) studies and is particularly well suited when one seeks to establish the credibility of qualitative analyses. Triangulation of information also helps overcome limitations imposed on qualitative studies via sampling criteria for reliability and validity combining multiple observers, theories, methods, and empirical materials, researchers can hope to overcome the weakness or intrinsic biases and the problems that come from single method, single-observer and single-theory studies.

The ESMS supplementary social baseline studies compile following sources of data to facilitate triangulation of data to inform social impact analysis:

  1. government statistics
  2. limited household surveys
  3. focus group discussions (FGD) / participatory rapid appraisal (PRA)
  4. key informant interviews


#### Analysis of Existing Government Data

*Badan Pusat Statistik* (BPS) of Maluku Tenggara Barat works with kecamatan-level governments to produce annual reports of socio-economic and health data in a series referred to collectively in this methodology as the *Badan Pusat Statistik* (BPS) *'Kecamatan' Dalam Angka* series.  A variety of government agencies supply indicator data for the *'Kecamatan' Dalam Angka* series, and much of the data they provide can be utilized to help inform ongoing analysis of potential project-induced impacts to local communities. Initial comparative analysis performed on all MTB *'Kecamatan' Dalam Angka*  demonstrate that reporting is  uneven for most socio-economic variables--to an extent that severely limits current capacity to use these data in studies of social change and sustainable development.  The distribution of topics varies greatly and few variable measures are uniformly disaggregated to the village level. Even fewer variables desegregate according to gender. The varying integrity of each underlying dataset and mistakes resulting from the process of government reporting and client re-capture are also processes certain to have introduced errors.   [All analysis therefore involves substantial interpretation and application of professional judgment.]

Consultancy is contributing on-going work to re-constitute, clean, and verify MTB government village-level data in a manner that is helpful for social analysis.  We will continue integrating government data sources as they become available to us.  Allowes are made within the scope of this methodology to pursue data access by working directly with key stakeholder informants. %%{[REFERENCE METHODOLOGY SECTION]}%%.  Consultancy will continue to seek access to data from the 2010 Indonesian Census, which records to the household level across the country.


#### Questionnaire Household Surveys

A questionnaire household survey is a method of direct data collection. General census surveys tend to ask a large number of questions in order to describe comparatively large populations.  A questionnaire household survey is a shorter form of questionnaire survey that focuses on a narrowly-defined set of targeted inquiries and collects data from only a small representative sample of respondents. Close-ended  design helps to facilitate a quantifiable dataset for subsequent statistical analysis, but these surveys are limited in how their results can credibly be generalized or extrapolated. Short surveys are therefore used primarily to augment and verify existing data sources. ESMS questionnaire surveys will therefore focus on obtaining nuanced quantification and measurements from respondents that are less likely to vary according to individual circumstances (e.g., costs, distances, time, and common forms of infrastructure) but reflect community-wide practice or experience. //%% {[IMPROVE]} %%//

**Characterization of Questionnaire Surveys**

* structured
* semi-random (tracking households interviewed, if possible)

---

ESMS supplementary baseline questionnaire surveys will last approximately one hour in duration. The ESMS team anticipates that on average respondents will answer 1 question every 1 minute (60 questions/hour)--although it is possible for a skilled enumerator and rapid respondent to make it through 1 question every 10 seconds (360 questions/hour).

Enumerators will ask as many questions as possible within that hour according to a structured interview schedule organized in priority 'modules'. In situations where enumerators are able to work through a multitude of questions, they will be asked to work through (and select) different sheets in order of priority.

Order of priority for structured surveys is as follows:

- identity distribution
- livelihoods
- living conditions
- health / security conditions
- access to basic services
- territorial ties / population mobility
- household composition
- asset ownership

The ESMS baseline schedule anticipates that one field enumerator can conduct 6 one-hour surveys in one day, and to keep this pace for a maximum of three days between rests.  Combining days of rest with transportation between and around study sites to maximize productive time, each period of ESMS field survey can only be reasonably planned for periods of up to four weeks in duration.

Dedicating two enumerators per team full-time to this task would allow for up to a maximum of 468 one-on-one interviews to be gathered during fieldwork. Sampling 468 people provides only ca. 60% confidence values for a populations of 105,341 [MTB total population according to BPS 2010 data] at a 0.018% degree of accuracy. This means that questionnaire surveys cannot be relied on alone to describe village socio-economic conditions with a high degree of certainty that the results reflect normal distributions (e.g., incidents of disease within a village).


#### Focus Group Discussions / Participatory Rapid Appraisal

Focus group discussions utilize an interactive group setting to facilitate rapid data collection, especially on topics that can be explored in depth via participant interaction. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) are typically small and informal gatherings where a facilitator guides conversations on pre-establish topics of interest. The forum encourages complexity of responses, behaviors and motivations. FGDs also provide contextual data and immediate feedback on research design and methodology.

**Characterization of FGD / PRA**

* semi-structured
* targeted population groups

----

As indicated above, representative village profiles cannot be rapidly generated based entirely on structured, one-on-one questionnaire surveys.  For this reason, the ESMS supplementary social baseline field team will utilize focus group discussions (FGDs) and participatory rapid appraisal (PRA) as alternative forms of data collection.

The advantages of FGD and PRA over questionnaire survey is that they can allow for the simultaneous collection of feedback from a number of respondents in a format that is also conducive to allowing respondents to collectively deliberate and adjust their responses--often improving the robustness and accuracy of the results.  FGD and PRA forms of data gathering are especially well suited to situations where respondents are being asked to enumerate varieties of different resources or when being asked to recall information about collective activities and shared cultural beliefs and values (such as the location of sacred sites, claims to communal land, or areas of cultural significance). FGDs can also be helpful in identifying points of disagreement between individual stakeholders and investigating the degree of shared understanding on a topic. FGDs are not, however, a formal means of consensus or decision-making and facilitators are cautioned not to attempt to resolve conflicts or to formalize any decision or course of action.

The disadvantages of FGD and PRA relative to questionnaire surveys is that oftentimes fewer questions can be covered on a single topic (since greater time and attention is spent on deliberating and refining answers). FGD and PRA are also more heavily dependent on the skill of their facilitators and data-recorders to capture 'survey' style data (such as the number of people living in houses built from different types of materials).  For this reason, FGD and PRA discussion topics and priority questions need to be carefully designed and practiced in advance of fieldwork.  Additionally, both the facilitators and the data-recorders need to be closely familiar with the full range of target questions and capable of shifting quickly among priority topics according to respondent interests. FGDs are less useful for gathering statistical data. It is also more challenging to conduct focus groups when language barriers are insurmountable or when the situation is not under the facilitator’s control.

FGD sessions will last approximately 2 hours. The ESMS team anticipates that on average respondents will answer 1 question every 3 minutes (20 questions/hour; 40 total), though it is possible to realize a response rate around 1 question every 2 minutes (30 questions/hour; 60 total). The ESMS team would be expected to be able to conduct between 3 and 4 FGD/PRA sessions on any given day.  Over the duration of a one-month study, the range of expected FGD/PRA studies is between 57 and 76 individual sessions.  Limiting the number of respondents for each session to a maximum of 16 people, the top potential number of respondents to be interviewed via FGD/PRA sessions is 1,216 people in total.

The order of topical priority for focus group discussions will follow a similar overall progression as that of the questionnaire survey questions. For each participating village community a standard set of topics will be raised in gender disaggregated FGD/PRA with community members covering key areas of Project interest, and likely impact, including (a) socio-economic livelihoods (b) cultural heritage and the role of tradition/ dispute resolution in the village (c) health and other services; and (d) community security.  

In addition to the standard set of topics, FGD facilitators will have discretion in selecting among one or more site specific themes to explore according to  particular conditions and circumstances of interest to FDD participants. Example topics include:

  * marine / coastal focused livelihoods
  * government services and access
  * livelihood opportunities and development constraints
  * gender, family and health

The ESMS supplementary baseline survey will utilize FGDs to gather data and insights from targeted stakeholder groups, including women, the disabled and vulnerable as well as youth groups and the elderly. FGD facilitators will create an environment in which stakeholders feel comfortable to share their views openly—providing a safe space and a chance for everyone speak freely.


#### Key Informant Interviews (KIIs)

Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) are one-on-one interviews and discussions. KIIs are a common technique for gathering specific information.  Such information may range from insights into stakeholder perspectives on such issues as social dynamics within a particular community or internal politics within a company or government agency.  KIIs rely on the knowledge and connections of particular individuals, such as sources of authority about a certain topic, or those with special access to data. KIIs are among the most commonly used methods of data collection for ‘needs assessment’, ethnographic or sociological research, monitoring and evaluation, and may also factor into safety audits and human rights monitoring.

Order of priority for targeted interviews is as follows:

- general census and socio-economic data
   * focusing especially on interviews with adat leaders, elderly women, people with subsistence-based livelihoods (the very poor), teachers, local business owners and other local notables

- health data
   * accessing inputs from healthcare practitioners (including Puskesmas representatives) and traditional healers

- information on sources and costs of basic services (access to water, food, medical treatment, and education)
   * focusing especially on interviews with  women, people with subsistence-based livelihoods (the very poor), commercial agencies supplying services; government agencies supplying services

- productivity of local markets by resource type
   * accessing inputs from suppliers, merchants, traders, local business owners and other local notables

- information on sources and costs of building supplies and materials
   * focusing especially on interviews with people with subsistence-based livelihoods (the very poor), local homeowners and local business owners


client has requested Consultancy--in addition to household surveys and FGD/PRA session--to gather updated socio-economic and census data from local institutions and government agencies.   ESMS supplementary baseline field team will dedicate at least one field researcher to pursuing secondary data access from local authorities and institutions.

It is very likely possible to improve coverage of available socio-economic data for baseline study by requesting materials directly from data suppliers.  The following government and civic groups supply the raw data upon which all *'Kecamatan' Dalam Angka* series are generated :

1.	Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika Saumlaki / Stasiun Meteorologi Saumlaki
1.	Badan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat Desa Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Badan Pusat Statistik
	- Badan Pusat Statistik ( Pemetaan Wilayah )
	- Badan Pusat Statistik (PODES)
	- BPS dan BPMD Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Data Dasar Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat
1.	Dinas Kebudayaan dan Pariwisata Kabupaten Maluku Tenggara Barat

%%{[INSERT ANNEX 3: Comparison of Needed Government Indicator Data by Kecamatan and Topical Category]}%%

Local-level (*kecamaten*) government agencies currently support data collection for some districts. To the extent possible, the  ESMS team will also solicit access to data from the *Kantor Kecamatan* and from and *Puskesmas* facility located within target study villages

### On-Going Impact Identification and Analysis: Proactive Planning to Enable a Robust M&E Framework

A 'household and community resources framework' us a a tool to organize basedline data to facilitate impact identification and analysis and to help inform the on-going development and refinement of action plans for impact mitigation and sustainable social development. This 'resources framework' approach to data organization draws on social research theory and has been applied to IFC client projects. Existing social baseline provide a partial dataset to inform analysis using the 'resources framework' approach; ESMS supplimentary baseline field studies seek to help fill remaining gaps ahead of the social impact assessment studies.

There are eight categories of resources under the framework:

1. human resources
2. social resources
3. cultural and religious resources
4. environmental resources
5. natural resources
6. livelihood resources
7. housing resources
8. basic services


#### Human Resources

The availability of labor, education and skills determine how a household can exploit livelihood resources available to it. Education plays a key role in providing individuals with the knowledge, skills and competences needed to participate effectively in society and in the economy. Having a good education greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money.The health and nutrition of the family are fundamental to a minimum level of well-being. Households with limited labour availability consisting of children, the elderly and infirm are more vulnerable to project impacts.

#### Social Resources

Trust in institutions is essential for social cohesion and well-being. Households form part of a community within a traditional and political setting. Households are typically dependent on a combination of family, community, traditional and political networks to gain access to land, housing and livelihood resources. Local community, traditional and political institutions can provide safety and security for households in time of natural and political disaster.


#### Cultural and Religious Resources

Common belief systems frame the existence of communities and provide psychological security to households. Culture and religion provide an identity and structure to households to engage and support one another.

#### Environmental Resources

Households and communities depend on the biophysical environment to maintain their health, safety and livelihoods. Disruptions to the quality of air, water, soil can impact negatively on the health and stability of households.

#### Natural Resources

Access to land, freshwater bodies, forests, marine and other natural resources is critical for the world’s population in providing ecosystem services including timber, medicines, food, and genetic resources, among others. Access to these resources is governed by community, traditional and political institutions.

#### Livelihood Resources

Livelihood activities (land, marine, wage and enterprise-based), remittances, bartering and labour exchanges contribute to household incomes and assets. Livelihood activities may include cropping, grazing, hunting, fishing, gathering, etc. and may derive from both agricultural and on-agricultural sources. A household’s access to livelihood resources is dependent on social, traditional and political institutions.

#### Housing Resources

Living in satisfactory housing conditions is one of the most important aspects of people’s lives. Housing is essential to meet basic needs, such as shelter, but it is not just a question of four walls and a roof. Housing should offer a place to sleep and rest where people feel safe and have privacy and personal space; somewhere they can raise a family. Shelter is one of the most basic requirements of any household that can be a major determinant of health. The tenure to residential land and dwelling is critical to guaranteeing shelter and livelihoods to households.

#### Access to Basic Services

Access to basic services including water supply, sanitation, education and health is a determinant of a household’s health and ability to exploit livelihood opportunities.
